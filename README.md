### Registers

| Register | Size | Purpose                                                                                                                          |
|----------|------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| X        | 8    | General purpose register.                                                                                                        |
| Y        | 8    | General purpose register.                                                                                                        |
| T        | 8    | General purpose register. Also stores the results of some operations.                                                            |
| PC       | 16   | Program counter. Initially set to 0x2000. This is where the attached ROM with a game begins (addresses 0x0000 - 0x1FFF are RAM). |


### Instruction set

All instruction names are 4 characters long.
All opcodes are 1-byte long, which means there is a maximum of 256 instructions, but most of these are unused. There may or may not be some undocumented instructions.

## Memory

The device has a RAM module with 8kb of memory, mapped to addresses 0x0000 - 0x1FFF. Some of these addresses are reserved for controlling inputs and outputs.

When a ROM with a game is loaded, the memory bank number 0 is attached to the device's memory so that it can be addressed by the range 0x2000 - 0xFFFF. This means that a memory bank has a maximum size of 56kb. If it's smaller, it will be padded with zeroes. Any write operations to addresses higher than 0x1FFF will be ignored.

The table below lists reserved memory areas and their purpose.


| Range       | Purpose           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x00 - 0x27 | Screen control    | The contents of these 40 bytes control the display. At the end of each frame, the screen is synchronized with this memory range by interpreting subsequent bits as pixels, row by row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 0x28        | Button inputs     | The device's buttons are stored in a single byte at this address. Each bit represents a single button and it is flipped as the button is pressed and released. 1 means a button is down, 0 means up. The 0th bit is the left d-pad button, 1st - up, 2nd - right, 3rd - down, 4th - A, 5th - B. 6th and 7th are unused. Writing to this memory has no effect, and it will be overwritten the next time any button's state changes. |
| 0x29 - 0x35 | 7-segment display | There are two 5-digit displays, and two 2-digit displays, for a total of 14 digits. This memory area controls their state, with each byte representing one digit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
