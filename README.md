Fictional cheap, Russian, electronic handheld game. 

## Technical specification

* 8-bit CPU
* 16-bit memory addresses
* 8kb of RAM (some mapped for specific purposes)
* 6 buttons (D-Pad, A, B)
* 2 audio channels (sin and noise, only one can be used at a time)
* 16x20 black and white screen (1 bit per pixel)
* Two 5 digit seven-segment displays for scores, etc
* Two 2 digit seven-segment displays for speed and level
* Games on ROM carts. Each cart can have up to 256 memory banks, and each bank can be up to 56kb long. 

## CPU

The cpu is intended to perform at a fixed speed of processing 65535 operations between every two frames. This makes the device state portable, and, excluding the button inputs, completely deterministic.


### Registers

| Register | Size | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                       |
|----------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| X        | 8    | General purpose register.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Y        | 8    | General purpose register.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| T        | 8    | General purpose register. Also stores the results of some operations.                                                                                                                         |
| S        | 8    | Status register. Interpreted as 8 1-bit flags. First flags represents waiting status (triggered by opcode 0x27), cleared when N is incremented. The other 7 bits are reserved for future use. |
| PC       | 16   | Program counter. Initially set to 0x2000. This is where the attached ROM with a game begins (addresses 0x0000 - 0x1FFF are RAM).                                                              |
| N        | 16   | Instruction count for current frame. Only used by internal logic, inaccessible and invisible for user programs.                                                                               |


### Operation

The following steps define the operation of the CPU:
* If S[0] != 1:
  * Read the byte at the address stored in PC
  * Increment PC
  * Execute the instruction identified by this opcode
* Increment N
* If N == 0xFF, sync screen with memory and clear S[0]
* Go to start

### Instruction set

All instruction names are 4 characters long.
All opcodes are 1-byte long, which means there is a maximum of 256 instructions, but most of these are unused. There may or may not be some undocumented instructions.

## Memory

The device has a RAM module with 8kb of memory, mapped to addresses 0x0000 - 0x1FFF. Some of these addresses are reserved for controlling inputs and outputs.

When a ROM with a game is loaded, the memory bank number 0 is attached to the device's memory so that it can be addressed by the range 0x2000 - 0xFFFF. This means that a memory bank has a maximum size of 56kb. If it's smaller, it will be padded with zeroes. Any write operations to addresses higher than 0x1FFF will be ignored.

The table below lists reserved memory areas and their purpose.


| Range       | Purpose           | Details                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x0000 - 0x0027 | Screen control    | The contents of these 40 bytes control the display. At the end of each frame, the screen is synchronized with this memory range by interpreting subsequent bits as pixels, row by row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 0x0028        | Button inputs     | The device's buttons are stored in a single byte at this address. Each bit represents a single button and it is flipped as the button is pressed and released. 1 means a button is down, 0 means up. The 0th bit is the left d-pad button, 1st - up, 2nd - right, 3rd - down, 4th - A, 5th - B. 6th and 7th are unused. Writing to this memory has no effect, and it will be overwritten the next time any button's state changes. |
| 0x0029 - 0x0035 | 7-segment display | There are two 5-digit displays, and two 2-digit displays, for a total of 14 digits. This memory area controls their state, with each byte representing one digit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

## ROMs

ROMs are binary files comprising of a header and game data.
The structure of the header is as follows:

| Field name   | Size (bytes) | Description                                                                                                                                |
|--------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Magic number | 4            | Magic number so that the program can confirm it's the correct file format. Must always be equal to 0x5A 0x45 0x0x55 0x53 (uppercase zeus). |
| Version      | 3            | Version of the file normat. The subsequent bytes represent the major, minor, and patch version.                                            |
| Reserved     | 25           | Reserved for future use, padding the header to 32 bytes total. Ignored for now, should be filled with zeroes.                              |

After the header section comes the game data. It's read as is and padded with zeroes to 56kb. The game data will be split into 56kb memory banks (up to 256) if there's more data in the file. In this case, the last bank will be padded.

## Rendering

No dedicated graphics unit.
As described in the RAM section, memory range 0x0000 - 0x0027 is mapped onto the screen. The contents of memory in this section are synchronized with screen state 30 times per second, instantly, between cpu instructions (so there's no way to change anything between rendering phases).
